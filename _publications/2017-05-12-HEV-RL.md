excerpt: 'We train a Reinforcement Learning agent to trade off the usage of electric motor and combustion engine in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle in order to optimize fuel consumption under constraints, e.g. balancing the battery charge. Our algorithm achieves near-optimal performance over a variety of different driving scenarios.'

We train a Reinforcement Learning agent to trade off the usage of electric motor and combustion engine in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle in order to optimize fuel consumption under constraints, e.g. balancing the battery charge. Our algorithm achieves near-optimal performance over a variety of different driving scenarios.
