Education
======
* Fulbright Scholar, University of Pennsylvania, 2017-2018
* Dipl.Ing., Technical University Dresden, 2012-2017
  * Specialization: Robotics, Automation and Control, GPA: 4.0 (<i>with distinction</i>)

Research Experience
======
* Fulbright Scholar, GRASP Lab, University of Pennsylvania (supervisor: <i>Kostas Daniilidis</i>)
  * <b>Unsupervised Activity Recognition</b>: Learn a viewpoint-independent embedding that discriminates actions of birds in video data without human training annotations.
* Diploma Thesis, Computer Vision Lab Dresden (supervisor: <i>Carsten Rother</i>)
  * <b>Object Pose Estimation</b>: Design, implement and test a geometry-based pipeline for 6DoF pose estimation of objects from single RGB/RGB-D input images using CNNs and RANSAC. Used dataset features texture-less objects and heavy occlusion.
