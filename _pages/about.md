I am a Fulbright scholar at the [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, working with professor [Kostas Daniilidis](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/). My main research interest is in building machines that learn in real world scenarios. 

Before coming to Philadelphia I obtained a Diploma in Electrical Engineering from the Technical University Dresden, Germany working on 6DoF object pose estimation with professor [Carsten Rother](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/people/carsten-rother/).
