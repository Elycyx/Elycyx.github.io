I am a Fulbright scholar in the [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, working with professor [Kostas Daniilidis](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/). My main research interest is in building machines that quickly learn to solve new tasks in real world scenarios, combining techniques from Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. 

Before coming to Philadelphia I obtained a Diploma in Electrical Engineering from the Technical University Dresden (Germany) working on 6DoF object pose estimation with professor [Carsten Rother](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/people/carsten-rother/).
